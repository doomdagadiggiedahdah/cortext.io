# Cortext.io

## Mission of the Project
Preserve Indigenous Languages 

by
expanding Cortext to 20 other languages
influencing "schema.org" to implement this **Semantic Calculus** across the web

## In Short
Powerful versions of Cortext LLM are held by IBM, Google, Twitter, ChatGPT ...

These companies provide consultations on how to ***engineer language*** to best accomplish sophist goals.
Cortext is a lightweight LLM that extracts "hashtags" and searches the most overlapping "Blue Words" in Wikipedia.

The Cortext LLM is more elegant than "Word2Vec" style Natural Language Processing, though crudely implemented... it is based on Wierzbicka's [Semantic Primes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_semantic_metalanguage), and has the potential to function in 20+ languages.
