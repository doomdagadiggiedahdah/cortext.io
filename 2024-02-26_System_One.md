# System One

This brings together [Richards Systems](https://richards.systems) into one system of re-search

## [Cortext.io](https://cortext.io)

### AS IS

- Cortext semi-structures natural language by extracting the **wikis** and **hashtags** of english text using a semantic arithmetic
- Cortext has scheduled news coming in from 15 categories
- Cortext leverages the elastic stack
    - Kibana allows for reporting

### TO BE

- Data science may be applied to this news corpus
    - Hypothesis: the Cortext semantic arithmetic requires less energy expenditure than the current "Word2Vec" methods of LLMs - because the semi-structuring is front-loaded
        - May work on 26+ languages
    - Pure linear algebra may be applied to the QUANTITIES (counts) of repeated occurrences of hashtags and wikis over a times series
    - Kibana has built-in query ratios that may find the "Blackrocks per Joe Bidens" - which may be correlated with economic KPI
- This data can be correlated with a news corpus Cortext collected between 2015-2017 (500K Articles)
